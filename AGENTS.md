# meshmcp

## Purpose
meshmcp is an **identity-native control plane for agent-to-tool (MCP) traffic**. It exposes local MCP servers as peers on an embedded NetBird userspace WireGuard mesh (no open ports, no admin rights) and enforces policy on every JSON-RPC call by the caller's cryptographic identity. Every request resolves to the peer's WireGuard public key (via `IdentityForIP`) — the root of a three-valued policy engine (allow / deny / co-sign), a tamper-evident hash-chained audit, a credential broker, and signed capabilities. The repository root is Go `package main`: the `meshmcp` CLI and all its subcommands. The reusable enforcement/transport logic lives in the sub-packages.

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.go` | CLI entry point and subcommand dispatch (`serve`, `router`, `call`, `capability`, `audit`, …). |
| `serve.go` | `meshmcp serve`: joins the mesh and, per inbound connection, spawns/proxies a backend wrapped in the policy filter. Builds engines, audit, tracer, secret broker, and capability verifier per backend. |
| `config.go` | YAML config: `Config`/`Backend`/`MeshConfig` + `loadConfig` validation (stdio vs http, policy, capabilities, secrets, resumable). |
| `cli.go` | Terminal MCP client commands (`ls`, `call`, `read`, `prompt`, `functions`, `function-call`); `dialMCP`, `--capability @file`. |
| `mesh.go` | `meshOptions` and joining the embedded NetBird mesh. |
| `acl.go` | `Allow` matching: which peers (FQDN glob / `pubkey:`) may use a backend. |
| `bridge.go` | `connect` — stdio ⇄ remote stdio backend bridge (`--resumable`). |
| `router.go` | `router` — aggregating endpoint: load-balance, failover, discovery, bidirectional MCP. |
| `orchestrate.go` | `orchestrate` — a server that calls other servers' tools over the mesh. |
| `federate.go` | `federate` — cross-org boundary exposing only granted tools (delegates to `federation/`). |
| `control.go` | `control` — managed control plane: enrollment, registry, policy distribution (delegates to `control/`). |
| `dash.go` · `room.go` | `dash` (live dashboard) and `room` (interactive Control Room: network view + console REPL + governed/raw shell). Both serve loopback-guarded HTML. |
| `approve.go` · `approvals.go` | Human co-sign: `approve` (CLI) and `approvals` (phone-friendly approver served over the mesh). |
| `audit.go` | `audit verify` / `audit keygen` over the signed hash-chained ledger. |
| `capabilitycmd.go` | `capability keygen` / `capability issue` — mint authority keys and short-lived signed tool grants. |
| `secretscmd.go` | `secrets check` — validate the credential broker config (never prints values). |
| `insight.go` | `insight profile/recommend/simulate/detect` — the firewall's read side (delegates to `insight/`). |
| `mcpapp.go` | `mcp` — run meshmcp *itself* as an MCP stdio server so Claude Code / Codex can operate the mesh. |
| `hookcmd.go` | `hook` — the client-hook firewall (F33): a PreToolUse/PostToolUse/prompt adapter for Claude Code / Cursor / Codex that governs *every* local tool call by policy + DLP + taint + audit (`hook install` prints the settings snippet). |
| `httppolicy.go` | `httpEnforcer` — per-tool policy + audit for HTTP backends (F16), reusing `policy.Engine`. |
| `budgetcmd.go` · `statuscmd.go` · `doctorcmd.go` · `configcmd.go` | `budget` / `status` / `doctor` / `config validate` — observability + pre-flight over the audit ledger and config. |
| `commands.go` · `auditsink.go` · `httpserve.go` | Plugin subcommand registry (`plugins`, F13/S40); webhook `AuditSink` (F15/S42); hardened loopback HTTP server (S25/S27). |
| `agent.go` | `agent --role …` — demo agent apps (reader/fetcher/billing/analyst) each with their own mesh identity. |
| `probe.go` · `replay.go` | `probe` (handshake diagnostic) and `replay` (re-issue a traced session and diff). |
| `README.md` · `LICENSE` | Project overview; proprietary license (© Rey Darius). |
| `index.html` | Published GitHub Pages site, merged to the code root (Pages still deploys from the `gh-pages` branch). |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Language is **Go 1.26**, module `meshmcp`. The root is `package main`; every `cmd*.go` file adds one CLI subcommand dispatched from `main.go`.
- This is **security-critical** code with fail-closed invariants (see `policy/AGENTS.md`). Preserve the ordering guarantees: audit → trace → secret injection **last**; capability/secret tokens are stripped before the backend, trace, and audit.
- Commit style: focused, direct to `main`, then push (no CI — GitHub Actions are billing-locked, so the local gate below *is* CI).

### Testing Requirements
- **Always** run the race suite with CGO on: `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -race`. On Windows `-race` **requires** `CGO_ENABLED=1` — omitting it is the most common failure.
- Full green gate: `CGO_ENABLED=1 go build ./... && CGO_ENABLED=1 go vet ./... && CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -race`.

### Common Patterns
- Errors are wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("…: %w", err)` and returned (fail-closed), not logged-and-continued.
- HTML surfaces escape `&<>"'` via `esc()` and avoid inline event handlers (XSS-hardened; use DOM APIs).
- Config validation lives in `loadConfig`; per-connection enforcement is built in `serve.go`'s `backendFactory`.

## Dependencies

### External
